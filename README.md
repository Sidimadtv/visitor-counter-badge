## Visitor Counter Badge 
Visitor counter badge is a simple API which serves badge from [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You can use this badge to count visitors for your GitHub Repositories or even your personal sites. The usage is very simple.

## Usage
You need a key and a value to create a unique key-value pair which will eventually be used to count visitors. SO considering you want to use the badge for your repository, `user/repo-name` can be a good unique key-value pair.

## A note on using
The API depends upon [countapi](https://countapi.xyz/) for counting visitors. Though it's kind of impossible, still if you get ratelimited by the API you can just host your own instance of this API using [Vercel](https://vercel.app/) and get unlimited personal requests!\
