## Visitor Counter Badge 
Visitor counter badge is a simple API which serves badge from [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You can use this badge to count visitors for your GitHub Repositories or even your personal sites. The usage is very simple.

## Usage
You need a key and a value to create a unique query combination which will eventually be used to count visitors. So considering you want to use the badge for your repository, `user/repo-name` can be a good unique query. For example `https://visitor-counter-badge.vercel.app/api/username/repo-name/` will return a badge where `username` is your github username and `repo-name` is your repository name.

## A note on usage
The API depends upon [countapi](https://countapi.xyz/) for counting visitors. Though it's kind of impossible, still if you get ratelimited by the API you can just host your own instance of this API using [Vercel](https://vercel.app/) and get unlimited personal requests!
